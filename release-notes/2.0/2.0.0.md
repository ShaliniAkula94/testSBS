# Release Notes

## Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 2.0.0 released 16 June 2020

This update brings the below changes over the previous release:

### Added
- Added internal driver support to provide resiliency to DNS failures [#594](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/594)
- Added support for `Active Directory Integrated`, `Active Directory Interactive` and `Active Directory Service Principal` authentication mode for .NET Core and .NET Standard [#560](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/560)
- Added support for `Active Directory Service Principal` authentication mode for .NET Framework [#560](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/560)
- Added support for optional `ORDER` hints in `SqlBulkCopy` for improved performance [#540](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/540)

### Fixed
- Fixed `SqlSequentialStream` multipacket read stalling issue in .NET Core [#603](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/603)
- Fixed code page issue for Kazakh collation in SQL Server [#584](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/584)
- Fixed stalled application issues when end of stream is reached [#577](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/577)
- Fixed driver behavior to not throw exception for invalid configuration file [#573](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/573)
- Fixed Object null reference issue when failover partner is set [#588](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/588)

### Changes
- Raise warning message when insecure TLS protocols are in use [#591](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/591)

### Breaking Changes
- Modified enclave provider interface `SqlColumnEncryptionEnclaveProvider` to be internal [#602](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/602) - _This change is not likely to impact customer applications since secure enclaves is a relatively new feature and they would have had to implement their own enclave provider, which is not a trivial task_.
- Updated `SqlClientMetaDataCollectionNames` exposed constants by removing non-existing constants and adding new to the metadata collection [#580](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/580)

### Additional Active Directory authentication modes
This release brings parity of Active Directory authentication modes supported for .NET Framework and .NET Core applications. With the 2.0 stable release, the following authentication modes are supported for **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient**:

|Authentication mechanism | .NET Framework 4.6+ | .NET Core 2.1+ | .NET Standard 2.0+|
|------|--------|--------|--------|
|Active Directory Password | Yes | Yes | Yes |
|Active Directory Integrated | Yes | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  |
|Active Directory Interactive | Yes | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  |
|**Active Directory Service Principal**<sup>1</sup> | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  | **Yes**<sup>1</sup>  |

_<sup>1</sup> New authentication mode starting with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient v2.0_

#### Active Directory Service Principal
This authentication mode uses Active Directory Service Principal to connect to an Azure SQL Database using the client ID and secret of a service principal identity. Service principal authentication involves setting up an App registration with a secret, granting permissions to the App in the Azure SQL Database instance, then connecting with a connection string like the following: 

`Server=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net;Database=<dbname>;Authentication=Active Directory Service Principal;User Id=<AppId>;Password=<Secret>;`

### EventSource tracing support
This release introduces support for capturing EventSource trace logs for debugging applications. In order to capture these traces, client applications must listen to events from SqlClient's EventSource implementation:

"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.EventSource"

Supported Event Keywords are:

| Keyword Name | Value | Description |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| ExecutionTrace | 1 | Turns on capturing Start/Stop events before and after command execution. |
| Trace | 2 | Turns on capturing basic application flow trace events. |
| Scope | 4 | Turns on capturing enter and exit events |
| NotificationTrace | 8 | Turns on capturing `SqlNotification` trace events |
| NotificationScope | 16 | Turns on capturing `SqlNotification` scope enter and exit events |
| PoolerTrace | 32 | Turns on capturing connection pooling flow trace events. |
| PoolerScope | 64 | Turns on capturing connection pooling scope trace events. |
| AdvancedTrace | 128 | Turns on capturing advanced flow trace events. |
| AdvancedTraceBin  | 256 | Turns on capturing advanced flow trace events with additional information. |
| CorrelationTrace | 512 | Turns on capturing correlation flow trace events. |
| StateDump | 1024 | Turns on capturing full state dump of `SqlConnection` |
| SNITrace | 2048 | Turns on capturing flow trace events from Managed Networking implementation (only applicable in .NET Core) |
| SNIScope | 4096 | Turns on capturing scope events from Managed Networking implementation (only applicable in .NET Core) |
|||


### Enable managed networking on Windows
This release introduces a new AppContext switch, "Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseManagedNetworkingOnWindows", that enables the use of Managed SNI on Windows for testing and debugging purposes. This switch will toggle the driver's behavior to use Managed SNI in .NET Core 2.1+ and .NET Standard 2.0+ projects on Windows. Using the managed SNI implementation eliminates the dependency on the native Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI binaries for a fully managed stack.

To set the switch from app startup, specify:

```cs
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseManagedNetworkingOnWindows", true);
```
> [NOTE] **Known differences when compared to Native SNI.dll**: Managed SNI does not support non-domain Windows Authentication.


### Enable decimal truncation behavior conditionally
Starting with v2.0.0-preview3, the decimal data scale will be rounded by the driver by default as is done by SQL Server.
For backwards compatibility, you can set the [AppContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.appcontext?view=netframework-4.8) switch "Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.TruncateScaledDecimal" to "true".

To set the switch at application startup, specify:

```cs
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.TruncateScaledDecimal", true);
```

### New Connection string property synonyms

The below connection properties can be interchangeably used with the new synonyms to avoid spacing confusion and for an enhanced user experience.

|Existing connection string property|New Synonym|
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| ApplicationIntent | Application Intent |
| ConnectRetryCount | Connect Retry Count |
| ConnectRetryInterval | Connect Retry Interval |
| PoolBlockingPeriod | Pool Blocking Period |
| MultipleActiveResultSets | Multiple Active Result Sets |
| MultiSubnetFailover | Multiple Subnet Failover |
| TransparentNetworkIPResolution | Transparent Network IP Resolution |
| TrustServerCertificate | Trust Server Certificate |

> [Note] This is not a breaking change. Old properties will continue to be supported for backwards compatibility.


#### SqlBulkCopy.RowsCopied property

This property provides read-only access to the number of rows processed in the ongoing bulk copy operation. Note that this value is not necessarily equal to the number of rows added to the destination table. 


#### Connection Open Overrides

The default behavior of `SqlConnection.Open()` can be overridden to disable the ten second delay and automatic connection retries triggered by transient errors.

```csharp
using SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=(local);Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;");
sqlConnection.Open(SqlConnectionOverrides.OpenWithoutRetry);
```

#### Username support for Active Directory Interactive mode

A username can now be specified in the connection string when using Azure Active Directory Interactive authentication mode for both .NET Framework and .NET Core targeted applications.

Set a username using the **User ID** or **UID** connection string property:

```
"Server=<server name>; Database=<dbname>; Authentication=Active Directory Interactive; User Id=<username>;"
```

#### Order hints for SqlBulkCopy

Bulk copy operations offer significant performance advantages over other methods for loading data into a SQL Server table. Performance can be further enhanced by using order hints. Specifying order hints for your bulk copy operations can lower the insertion time of sorted data into tables with clustered indexes.

By default, the bulk insert operation assumes the incoming data is unordered. SQL Server forces an intermediate sort of this data before bulk loading it. If you know that your incoming data is already sorted, you can use order hints to tell the bulk copy operation about the sort order of any destination columns that are part of a clustered index.


#### SNI dependency changes

Microsoft.Data.SqlClient (.NET Core and .NET Standard) on Windows is now dependent on **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime**, replacing the previous dependency on **runtime.native.System.Data.SqlClient.SNI**. The new dependency adds support for the `ARM` platform along with the already supported platforms `ARM64`, `x64` and `x86` on Windows.
